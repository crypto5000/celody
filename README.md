# Celody
Celody uses crytocurrency to make music. With Celody, a group of remote people can collaborate on a song and then distribute the song inside a market. Visit https://celody.com for more information.

The song structure is pulled from the blockchain. Edits to the master song version are merged back into the ledger. The highest valued transaction for each part (song name, band name, instruments, and vocals) becomes the master version.

# Tokens
The supported tokens (currently) are bitcoin, ethereum, iota, and eos. Celody can support most blockchains.
