The html files show working examples that use the Celody core code. To play an infinite stream make sure you have the required dependencies below. If you have problems, please open up an issue on Github.

REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES: SEE JS FOLDER AND SOUND FOLDER
1) PIZZICATO.JS
2) XSS.JS
3) SOUNDS (MP3 FILEs) HOSTED ON YOUR OWN DOMAIN

helloWorld.html: This example shows a play and stop link for a single hardcoded Celody stream file. Click "play" to start the stream. Click "stop" to stop the stream. The sounds must be hosted on a web server and the fileSource path must include your host domain (replace the celody.com domain).
